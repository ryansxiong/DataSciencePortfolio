[link to full code](https://github.com/ryansxiong/DS_Demographic_EDA/blob/main/DS%20demographic%20data%20EDA%20.ipynb)

Cleaned and analyzed demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 census database. Below are the questions that I answered while exploring the data.
* How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
* What is the average age of men?
* What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
* What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
* What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
* What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
* What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
* What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
* Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

This data science project is where I look at the differences between casual and member cyclist riders.
* Used pandas to clean and analyzed data.
* Used matplotlib as a visualization tool to have a better understanding of the data.
