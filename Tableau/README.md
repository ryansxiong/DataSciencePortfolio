Created an interactive dashboard for the video game sales project. Below are features that I wanted in the dashboard.
* Shows global sales over time (1980 - 2020)
* choose the specific region and year to show sales for both the platform and genre.
  * Bar graph and numbers chart changes accordingly to which region and year is selected above.
