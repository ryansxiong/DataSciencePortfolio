# [Project 3: Video Game Sales (EDA)](https://github.com/ryansxiong/Video_Game_Sales_ds_proj)
The purpose for this project is to use exploratory analysis to understand how the data is distributed and to find insights for future decision-making. My analysis for video game sales are from 1980-2020. In this project you will find questions that I predicted stake holders will want to know about the data. I also created an easy to use interactive dashboard using Tableau.

# [Project 4: New World Quests DS](https://github.com/ryansxiong/DS_New_World_Quests)
For this project, I wanted to find the fastest way to level up for the new released game from Amazon. I webscraped hundreds of pages to find the quests that give you the most xp. I was able to find which quests types you should focus on for each level you progress in the game. I also found that main and side quests give you the most xp per quest completion.

# [Project 5: Cyclist Project](https://github.com/ryansxiong/DS_cyclist_project)
This project is a capstone project from my google analytics certification course. The scenario provided was that a cyclist company wanted to know how you can transition more casual riders to become members. The main question from the stake holder was to find the differences between casual riders and members. Through analysis, I was able to find many differences on how casual and members use this service (seasonal trend, average time riden, etc.), and provided some recommendations on how to gain more members.
