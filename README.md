# [Project 1: Video Game Sales Estimator (Project Overview)](https://github.com/ryansxiong/VG_Sales_Estimator) 
* Created a model to forecast video game sales.
* Cleaned the data and engineered features to optimize the model.
* Optimized lasso, random forest regressor, and gradient boosting regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.

# [Project 2: Video Game Sales EDA (Project Overview)](https://github.com/ryansxiong/Video_Game_Sales_ds_proj)
The purpose for this project is to use exploratory analysis to understand how the data is distributed and to find insights for future decision-making. My analysis for video game sales are from 1980-2020. In this project you will find questions that I predicted stake holders will want to know about the data. I also created an easy to use interactive dashboard using tableau.
